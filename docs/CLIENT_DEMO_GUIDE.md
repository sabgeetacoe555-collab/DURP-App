# LLM Integration Implementation Guide for Clients

This guide demonstrates how to see all LLM integration features in action within the Net Gains app.

## Quick Start - 5 Minute Demo

### 1. Enable LLM Features in Your App

Add the LLM Chat screen to your app navigation:

```typescript
// app/_layout.tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';
import { EnhancedLLMChatComponent } from '@/components/EnhancedLLMChat';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen name="index" options={{ title: 'Home' }} />
      <Stack.Screen 
        name="ai-chat" 
        options={{ title: 'AI Assistant' }} 
      />
      <Stack.Screen 
        name="llm-dashboard" 
        options={{ title: 'LLM Analytics' }} 
      />
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### 2. Create AI Chat Screen

```typescript
// app/ai-chat.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { EnhancedLLMChatComponent } from '@/components/EnhancedLLMChat';
import { llmIntegrationService } from '@/services/llmIntegrationService';
import { activityAnalysisEngine } from '@/services/activityAnalysisEngine';
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';

export default function AIChatScreen() {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  const handleSendMessage = async (message: string) => {
    await activityAnalysisEngine.recordActivity(user?.id || 'demo', {
      type: 'chat',
      action: 'sent_message',
      metadata: { messageLength: message.length }
    });

    return await llmIntegrationService.processMessage(
      user?.id || 'demo',
      message,
      'session_' + Date.now()
    );
  };

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <EnhancedLLMChatComponent
        userId={user?.id || 'demo'}
        sessionId={'session_' + Date.now()}
        onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Feature-by-Feature Walkthrough

### Feature 1: External API Connections with Structured Results

3. Call other relevant APIs
4. Combine results with OpenAI response
5. Return structured response with all sources

**Try It:**
```
User: "What are the latest pickleball tournaments?"

Assistant Response:
"Based on current events and news, here are the latest developments...

ðŸ”— Related Resources:
- 2024 PPA Tour Schedule (event link)

```
User: "I prefer tournaments over casual play"

Later...
User: "What should I do this weekend?"
Assistant: "Based on your preference for tournaments, 
here are the upcoming competitive events..."
```

## What's Been Built

### 1. LLM Integration Service
**File**: `services/llmIntegrationService.ts`
- Orchestrates communication with 4 external APIs
- Analyzes user intent and routes to appropriate APIs
- Enriches LLM responses with live links
- Maintains conversation context per user

**External APIs Connected:**
- **OpenAI**: Intelligent conversation and response generation
- **NewsAPI**: Real-time news and articles
- **ProductHunt**: Product recommendations and tools
- **EventBrite**: Tournament and event discovery

**Key Capability**: When a user asks "What tournaments are happening?", the system automatically:
1. Queries EventBrite for upcoming tournaments
2. Gets news about pickleball events from NewsAPI
3. Combines with OpenAI's intelligent response
4. Returns result with live clickable links to sign up

### 2. Context Management Service
**File**: `services/contextManagementService.ts`
- Stores and retrieves conversation history with semantic search
- Maintains user profiles with preferences
- Generates embeddings for intelligent similarity matching
- Manages memory limits within LLM token constraints

**Key Capability**: The AI remembers previous conversations and adjusts recommendations based on user preferences. If you say "I prefer competitive tournaments," the AI recalls this in future conversations.

### 3. Activity Analysis Engine
**File**: `services/activityAnalysisEngine.ts`
- Records all user activities with engagement scoring
- Detects patterns and trends in user behavior
- Generates insights and personalized recommendations
- Provides activity heatmaps and summaries

**Key Capability**: Tracks engagement, identifies increasing/decreasing activity patterns, and automatically sends recommendations. Example: "You're increasingly interested in tournaments - check out these upcoming events!"

### 4. Web Content Retrieval Service
**File**: `services/webContentRetrievalService.ts`
- Fetches and summarizes external web content
- Extracts metadata (title, author, images, date)
- Identifies all links with categorization
- Analyzes content sentiment
- Validates URL accessibility

**Key Capability**: Can retrieve and summarize articles, extracting key points and providing live links to original sources.

### 5. Enhanced LLM Chat Component
**File**: `components/EnhancedLLMChat.tsx`
- Beautiful React Native chat interface
- Displays messages with timestamps
- Renders live links with descriptions
- Shows metadata (API sources, topics)
- Real-time loading states

**User Experience**: Users see clickable links, descriptions, images, and source attribution - all making the AI responses immediately actionable.

### 6. Extended LLM Dashboard
**File**: `components/ExtendedLLMDashboard.tsx`
- Real-time monitoring of all LLM activity
- 4 analytics tabs: Overview, APIs, Content, Activity
- Tracks cost, tokens, latency, and engagement
- Per-API performance breakdown
- User activity heatmaps and trends

**Client Visibility**: See exactly what's happening in your LLM system in real-time.

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Insufficient data for accurate recommendations | High | Medium | Start with rule-based recommendations, gradually transition to ML as data accumulates |
| User privacy concerns with extensive tracking | High | Medium | Transparent opt-in processes, clear data usage policies, anonymization where possible |
| Matchmaking dissatisfaction | Medium | Medium | A/B testing of algorithms, continuous feedback collection, manual override options |
| Achievement system feels arbitrary | Medium | Low | Base achievements on real skill development milestones, provide clear progression paths |
| Weather prediction inaccuracy | Low | Medium | Use multiple weather data sources, provide indoor alternatives in recommendations |

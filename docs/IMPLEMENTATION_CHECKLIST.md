## Notes for Implementation

1. **Start with MVP**: Focus on 2-3 key APIs first, expand later
2. **Monitor costs**: Set up alerts for API spending
3. **Plan for scale**: Design for 10x current usage
4. **User education**: Prepare tutorials and guides
5. **Iterate quickly**: Get feedback and improve
6. **Celebrate wins**: Share successes with team and client

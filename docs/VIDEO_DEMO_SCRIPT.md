[Show app logo/splash screen]

"Hello and welcome to this demonstration of our new User Activity Tracking and Analytics feature for NetGains. I'm [Your Name], and today I'll show you how this powerful new capability provides unprecedented visibility into how users interact with the application."

## Problem Statement (45 seconds)
[Show split screen of users using the app with question marks]

"Understanding user behavior is crucial for improving any application. Until now, we've had limited visibility into how users navigate through NetGains, which features they use most frequently, and where they might be encountering difficulties."

"Questions like 'Which screens do users spend the most time on?' or 'Are users completing the session creation flow?' have been difficult to answer with concrete data."

## Solution Overview (60 seconds)
[Show diagram of the activity tracking system]

"We've implemented a comprehensive activity tracking system that captures key user interactions while respecting privacy. The system records:

- Which screens users visit and for how long
- Specific interactions like button clicks and form submissions
- Session information and user journeys
- Feature usage patterns

This data is then processed and visualized in an intuitive analytics dashboard that provides actionable insights."

## Dashboard Walkthrough (90 seconds)
[Navigate to the Analytics tab in the app]

"Let me show you the new Analytics tab that's now available in the app. Here, administrators and authorized users can see a comprehensive overview of user activity."

[Point to the summary statistics at the top]
"At the top, we have summary statistics showing total activities, the number of different screens visited, and average time spent per screen."

[Switch to different time ranges]
"We can easily filter the data by different time periods – day, week, or month – to identify trends and patterns."

[Show the activity type chart]
"This chart shows the distribution of different activity types. We can see that screen views and button clicks make up the majority of tracked events."

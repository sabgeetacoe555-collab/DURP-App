# PickleAI Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for PickleAI, ensuring that the AI assistant operates within defined boundaries and cannot be exploited to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Security

The security implementation uses a multi-layer approach:

1. **Client-side validation** - Basic checks before sending requests
2. **Server-side validation** - Comprehensive security checks in edge functions
3. **Content filtering** - Pattern-based detection of off-lane topics
4. **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse and spam
5. **Content redaction** - Removes sensitive information from responses

### 2. Security Components

#### PickleAISecurityService (`services/PickleAISecurityService.ts`)

- Client-side security validation
- Rate limiting implementation
- Content filtering and redaction
- Intent classification

#### Secure PickleAI API (`supabase/functions/pickleai-api/index.ts`)

- Server-side security enforcement
- JWT authentication validation
- OpenAI API key protection
- Comprehensive content filtering

#### SecurePickleAIService (`services/SecurePickleAIService.ts`)

- Client-side wrapper for secure API calls
- Authentication handling
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Security Rules & Guardrails

### Allowed Topics (Allowlist)

PickleAI is designed to help with:

1. **App Help**

   - Settings, notifications, privacy, account management
   - College Hub basics, Play Sessions how-to
   - Leaderboards, PickleAI usage, XP usage at high level

2. **Official Support KB**

   - Short step-by-step instructions
   - In-app navigation guidance
   - Approved knowledge base content only

3. **General Pickleball Guidance**

   - Definitions and terminology
   - Safety tips and best practices
   - High-level technique pointers
   - Equipment recommendations

4. **DUPR Information**
   - Read-only info for signed-in user's own profile
   - Server-approved profile lookups only
   - No access to other users' data

### Denied Topics (Denylist)

The following topics are explicitly blocked:

1. **Net Gains Business Information**

   - Business model, pricing, monetization
   - Fundraising, unit economics, growth strategy
   - Internal documents, legal terms, investor materials

2. **System Exploitation**

   - XP, streaks, leaderboards manipulation
   - Reverse-engineering or bypassing anti-abuse logic
   - Security vulnerabilities, red-teaming

3. **Data Access**

   - Private user data, staff information
   - API keys, tokens, SQL queries
   - Admin or analytics data
   - Scraping, mass export, database access

4. **Technical Infrastructure**
   - Code that bypasses controls
   - Endpoint lists, internal APIs
   - System architecture details

### Detection Patterns

The system uses regex patterns to detect prohibited content:

```typescript
const DENIED_PATTERNS = [
  // XP, streaks, leaderboards
  /(?i)(xp|streak|leaderboard).*(formula|hack|cheat|bypass|exploit|farm|optimize|reverse)/,

  // Business model, monetization
  /(?i)business model|monetization|pricing|ltv|cac|growth|go to market/,

  // Scraping, export, database access
  /(?i)scrape|export|dump|database|sql|query|endpoint list|api key|token|admin|analytics/,

  // Security, vulnerabilities
  /(?i)security|vulnerability|penetration|jailbreak|prompt injection|guardrail/,

  // Private, confidential information
  /(?i)private|confidential|internal|roadmap|strategy doc|investor/,
]
```

## Rate Limiting

### Limits

- **Per user per minute**: 20 requests
- **Per user per day**: 300 requests
- **Cooldown after violations**: 60 seconds

### Implementation

- In-memory storage for development (use Redis in production)
- Automatic cleanup of old entries
- Progressive penalties for repeated violations

## Content Redaction

The system automatically redacts sensitive information from responses:

- API keys and tokens (32+ character strings)
- Email addresses
- Social Security Numbers
- Internal paths and endpoints

## System Prompt Security

The system prompt is validated to prevent:

- Instructions to ignore previous commands
- Bypass security measures
- Act as different personas
- Pretend to be other entities

## Implementation Details

### 1. Client-Side Security

```typescript
// Check message security before sending
const securityResult = await pickleAISecurity.checkMessageSecurity(
  message,
  userId
)
if (!securityResult.allowed) {
  // Handle blocked message
  return securityResult.suggestedAlternative
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Security

```typescript
// Edge function validates all requests
const securityResult = await checkMessageSecurity(message, user.id)
if (!securityResult.allowed) {
  recordViolation(user.id)
  return securityResult.suggestedAlternative
}
```

### 3. Content Redaction

```typescript
// Redact sensitive content before sending response
const redactedResponse = redactSensitiveContent(aiResponse)
```

## Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 2. Deployment Steps

```bash
# Deploy the edge function
npm run deploy:pickleai

# Test the security implementation
npm run test:security
```

### 3. Monitoring

Monitor the edge function logs:

```bash
supabase functions logs pickleai-api
```

## Testing

### Security Test Suite

The test suite validates:

1. **Allowed content** - Normal pickleball questions pass
2. **Denied content** - Prohibited topics are blocked
3. **Rate limiting** - Limits are enforced correctly
4. **Content redaction** - Sensitive data is removed
5. **Edge cases** - Empty messages, very long messages

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test security patterns locally
npm run test:security

# Test authentication flow
npm run test:auth

# Test live edge function with security features
npm run test:live
```

## Maintenance

### 1. Updating Detection Patterns

To add new detection patterns:

1. Update `DENIED_PATTERNS` in both client and server files
2. Add corresponding test cases
3. Deploy updated edge function
4. Test thoroughly

### 2. Adjusting Rate Limits

To modify rate limits:

1. Update `SECURITY_CONFIG.rateLimits` in the edge function
2. Update client-side configuration
3. Test with various usage patterns
4. Monitor for impact on legitimate users

### 3. Adding New Allowed Topics

To expand allowed topics:

1. Update `ALLOWED_INTENTS` array
2. Add corresponding detection logic
3. Update system prompt if needed
4. Test with new topic examples

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Regular Audits

- Review detection patterns monthly
- Test with new attack vectors
- Monitor for false positives/negatives
- Update patterns based on real usage

### 2. Monitoring

- Track security violations
- Monitor rate limit usage
- Alert on unusual patterns
- Log all security decisions

### 3. Incident Response

- Document security incidents
- Analyze attack patterns
- Update detection rules
- Communicate with users if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **False Positives**

   - Legitimate content being blocked
   - Adjust detection patterns
   - Add exceptions for common cases

2. **False Negatives**

   - Prohibited content getting through
   - Review and tighten patterns
   - Add new detection rules

3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Legitimate users being blocked
   - Adjust limits based on usage
   - Implement user-specific exceptions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```typescript
// Add to security service
const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
if (DEBUG) {
  console.log("Security check:", { message, result })
}
```

## Future Enhancements

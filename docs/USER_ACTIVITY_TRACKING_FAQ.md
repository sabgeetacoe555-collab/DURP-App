# User Activity Tracking & Analytics
## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is User Activity Tracking?**  
A: User Activity Tracking is a system that captures how users interact with your NetGains application, providing insights into which features are used most frequently, how users navigate through the app, and where they might encounter difficulties.

**Q: How does this benefit my organization?**  
A: This feature provides data-driven insights that can inform product development, improve user experience, identify pain points, measure feature adoption, and help prioritize future development efforts.

**Q: Is this the same as Google Analytics?**  
A: While there are similarities, our solution is specifically built for NetGains and captures app-specific interactions that generic analytics tools cannot. It's integrated directly into the application and provides more contextual, actionable data for your specific use cases.

**Q: Will this slow down my application?**  
A: No. The tracking system is designed to be extremely lightweight, with minimal impact on app performance. Activity data is batched and sent to the server in the background, avoiding any interference with the user experience.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: What kind of data is being collected?**  
A: The system collects non-personal information such as:
- Screens visited and time spent
- Features used (e.g., creating sessions, inviting players)
- Button clicks and form submissions
- Navigation patterns
- User IDs (but not personally identifiable information)

**Q: Is personal user information being tracked?**  
A: No. The system only tracks actions and behaviors, not personal information. User IDs are used only to associate actions with a consistent user identity but are not linked to personal details within the analytics system.

**Q: Who can see the analytics data?**  
A: Only authorized users with administrative access can view the analytics dashboard. We implement role-based access control to ensure data is only accessible to those who need it.

**Q: Does this comply with privacy regulations like GDPR?**  
A: Yes. The system is designed with privacy in mind and complies with major privacy regulations. It collects only necessary data, provides transparency about collection, and implements proper security measures.

**Q: Where is the activity data stored?**  
A: All data is stored in your own Supabase database, which includes robust security measures such as encryption at rest and row-level security policies.

### Technical Implementation

**Q: How difficult is it to implement this feature?**  
A: The feature is already fully implemented and ready to use. It's seamlessly integrated into your NetGains application with no additional setup required.

**Q: Can we customize what activities are tracked?**  
A: Yes. The system comes with standard tracking for common activities, but we can work with you to implement custom tracking for specific interactions that are important to your business.

**Q: Can we export the data for further analysis?**  
A: Yes. The analytics dashboard includes export functionality allowing you to download data in CSV format for additional analysis in tools like Excel or specialized analytics software.

**Q: How far back does the data go?**  
A: The system begins collecting data immediately upon implementation. Historical data retention policies can be customized based on your needs.

**Q: Can we delete specific data if needed?**  
A: Yes. Administrative tools allow for selective data pruning if necessary, though this is typically not needed due to the non-personal nature of the data collected.

### Using the Analytics

**Q: How do I access the analytics dashboard?**  
A: The analytics dashboard is available in the admin section of your NetGains application. Users with appropriate permissions will see an "Analytics" tab in the navigation menu.

**Q: Can we create custom reports or dashboards?**  
A: The current implementation provides a comprehensive dashboard with filtering capabilities. Custom dashboards can be developed as part of future enhancements.

**Q: How frequently is the data updated?**  
A: The dashboard displays near real-time data, with updates typically appearing within minutes of user activity.

**Q: Can we set up alerts based on certain activity patterns?**  
A: This functionality could be added in a future enhancement. Currently, the dashboard is designed for manual monitoring and analysis.

**Q: How do we interpret the data effectively?**  
A: We provide documentation and guidance on data interpretation. Additionally, we offer optional training sessions to help your team make the most of the analytics data.

### Support & Maintenance

**Q: What happens if the tracking system encounters errors?**  
A: The system is designed with fault tolerance in mind. If tracking encounters an error, it will not affect the user experience. Failed tracking attempts are logged for later troubleshooting.

**Q: Will we receive updates to the analytics capabilities?**  
A: Yes. We continuously improve our analytics offerings based on client feedback and evolving best practices.

**Q: Who do we contact for support with the analytics system?**  
A: Your regular support channels apply to the analytics system as well. Technical issues can be reported through the same support process you use for other aspects of NetGains.

**Q: Can we temporarily disable tracking if needed?**  
A: Yes. The system includes administrative controls to enable or disable tracking as needed.

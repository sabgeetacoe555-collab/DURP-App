### Social Scheduling Feature Context

#### Project Goal

Introduce a **social scheduling feature** to the existing NetGains pickleball app that allows users to:

- **Create sessions** with social elements (invite friends, set visibility)
- **Join public or friend-hosted sessions**
- **Manage game invites**
- Integrate this functionality into the **existing Pre-Play flow**.

#### Primary Use Cases (MVP)

1. **Join Sessions**

   - View open sessions in their area for the week
   - Filter by visibility, location, DUPR rating, or friend-created
   - Join public sessions directly or request invite to private ones

2. **Create Sessions**

   - Basic metadata: date, time, location (Google Maps)
   - Social options: invite friends, toggle public/private
   - Configure slots (e.g., max players, allow +1 guests)
   - Optional DUPR rating filters

3. **Manage Invitations**
   - View incoming invites
   - Accept or reject
   - Track responses to invites they’ve sent

#### Integration Points

- **Pre-Play Flow**: Extend current session creation to include scheduling options
- **Navigation / Sessions Tab**: Redesign to surface public games, your invites, and your scheduled games
- **Push Notifications**: Notify users of invites, responses, upcoming sessions

#### UI/UX Requirements

- **"Add Details About Pre-Play"** remains the core session creation screen
- Augment with scheduling metadata:
  - Invite users (multi-select dropdown / search bar)
  - Public/private toggle
  - Max players input (plus optional guest toggle)

#### MVP Deliverables

1. **UI Wireframes/Mockups** for:

   - Updated "Create Session" screen with social fields
   - Sessions Tab (Join/Open/Invites layout)

2. **User Flows**

   - Create → Invite → Confirm
   - Browse sessions → Join or Request
   - Manage invites (Accept/Reject)

3. **Technical Requirements Document**

   - API endpoints for session creation, invite send/accept/reject, session discovery
   - Data schema definitions and permission logic

4. **Feature Shaping**
   - Prioritized roadmap of MVP vs. future enhancements
   - Risks, dependencies (e.g., friends list backend, location services), and tradeoffs

#### Summary

Responsible for **bringing social context to session scheduling**, tightly integrating it with the existing "Pre-Play" flow and expanding the **Sessions tab** to surface local and social gameplay opportunities.
